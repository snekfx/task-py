we need to create a python tool to manage our META PROCESS which defines our agentic development cycle, currently we
  put instruction docs in docs/dev to spell out the guidelines, and an agent employ meta process to creat docs/procs
  which create self hydrating docs like QUICKREF TASKS DONE etc, the ai agents have to manually update this and it
  gets messy. we arent quite ready for a db-driven task system, maybe just a file-base one with a TSV or CSV. so i
  createdf this task-py project to help us on that front, basically we want to follow a typical agile process with
  vanity epic namespaces for certain tasks types, either relating to the project or context specific like BUGS-NN,
  DOCS-NN, REF-NN (refactor), RX-NN (research) with story point breakdowns and possible subtasks, think like a
  text-based JIRA but simpler. the agent should be able to use the taskpy tool to determine next priorities change
  status of tickets, create and move tickes (to done or backlog), and link reference docs and code to tickets; as a
  reference most of our rust projects and some of our projects use docs/procs to a varying degree and manually update
  all their docs including a HANDOFF.md; i think a tool would power this better. i think the tool should have a taskpy
  init command to stub out a data folder relative to the project root ./data/kanban and in a typical light weight
  kanban move tasks across different states (and back as needed) add notes and feedback etc, and init should also add
  the kanban to gitignore (create it if its missing); I feel like each task should have its own md file so that
  sufficient detail can be provided as needed. we could do taskpy promote <TASK>-<NN> or something like that to
  migrate through the kanban buckets -- we can have data/kanban/info for meta information like creating a doc that
  lists the allowed EPIC names and allow users to register new ones, so when tasks are created they use one of the
  defined ones; and buckets are just data/kanban/status/<status_dir> so actual tickets get moved literaly through
  taskpy and a manifest gets updated. taskpy can query the manifest to get a list of tasks either all or through some
  filter -- for reference you can find repos/docs/brain i think has a canonical copy of meta process should be there
  and a sample procs/procs.sample that shows how a repo used this meta process - it gets a little sloppy as agents
  start creating files all over the place, i think a better approach is to use  our standard docs/plan directory to
  create strategic detail documents with a PLAN-NN prefix and ot be able to link them to relevant tasks as a
  reference, we also have NFR's that we should keep a manifest of, including a default set; so they can be appended to
  tasks for verification -- and maybe a taskpy verify command that checks that the tests for the particular work done
  are green -- for example at one stage in the lifecycle the developer/agent can add the tests needed for the
  particular ticket via a lifecycle command -- taskpy can call the runner to verify whatever test is needed. we also
  have a testpy and featpy tools that help validate test structure and module structure (module spec v4) and they
  could play together nicely. you can refer to the adjacent python projects to see what theyre using. and we primarily
  want to use this right now with our rust projects but this could branch out to our node and pythong projects so we
  should leave room for extensibility.
