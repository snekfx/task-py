+ Ticket numbers should limit to <EPIC>-99, and only count up to 3 digits when that is passed.

+ taskpy demote <ticket> (roll it back to the previous state)

+ demote and promote should error on rolls beyond their boundaries

+ create command should provide the ticket title; Example:
  > taskpy create FEAT "Add dark mode" --sp 8
  creates:
    FEAT-99.md
      # FEAT-NN Add Doc Mode
      etc...
      <body>

  however this does not provide a detail body or subtasks.

+ we should have a --body "" flag
+ we should have link subtask command

+ epics are largely self describing in terms of ticket types, some other vanity epics may be used, we should prove a register command like taskpy <register> <epic> <purpose> (? does our epic manifest provide a description like field)

+ we should warn on tickets bigger than 3 story points that they need proper breakdown (force into stub status) 

+ force incomplete tickets into 'stub' status which cannot be worked on until completed, can be promoted to first stage if necessary details and verification is provided

+ taskpy split <ticket> to create a subset of tickets, from a ticket too big (+3), like EPIC-01 is too big -> creates EPIC-01a EPIC-O1b EPIC-01c and links them all together as related deps, all as stubs, waiting for proper details.

+ what is an incomplete ticket? 
  - ticket id
  - title
  - body
  - others?
  - optional?
